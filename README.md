# PALUnitTesting

A lightweight automated unit testing framework.

## Motivation
This project was created for Peer Assisted Learning [(PAL)](https://www.thesubath.com/peer-support/pal/), a programme run by second year students (known as PAL Leaders) for first years (students), designed to help facilitate discussion about the course content.

As part of being a PAL Leader, we found that students benefitted greatly from coding exercises based on content that was covered that week.

Given we ran our PAL sessions during the COVID pandemic, we found it was easiest to create and share these exercises using [repl.it](https://replit.com/), an online IDE that supports most languages.

However, at the time, replit didn't have easy support for automated test units, or the use of libraries such as JUnit. Therefore, I opted to create a lightweight version of a testing framework (contained in a single .java file that can be copy and pasted into exercises).

This allowed PAL Leaders to create automated test units for students, giving them instant feedback on how they're getting on with the exercise remotely.

_(This project also exists partly as an excuse to dive into tools like JUnit work.)_
